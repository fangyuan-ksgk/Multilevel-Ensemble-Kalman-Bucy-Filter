# Multilevel-Ensemble-Kalman-Bucy-Filter

This repository contains the main code for constructing a Multilevel Ensemble Kalman Bucy Filter with a randomized model in high dimension. A Deterministic Multilevel Ensemble Kalman Bucy Filter is also construced in the Jupyterbook. 

If you are interested in using this code, please cite our paper which describes this methodology:
