# Multilevel-Ensemble-Kalman-Bucy-Filter

This repository contains the main code for constructing a Multilevel Ensemble Kalman Bucy Filter with a randomized model in high dimension. A Deterministic Multilevel Ensemble Kalman Bucy Filter is also constructed in the Jupyterbook. 

Many thanks to my collaborators: Prof.Ajay Jasra and Dr.Neil Chada
