# Multilevel-Ensemble-Kalman-Bucy-Filter

This repository contains the main code for constructing a Multilevel Ensemble Kalman Bucy Filter with a randomized model in high dimension. A Deterministic Multilevel Ensemble Kalman Bucy Filter is also constructed in the Jupyterbook. 

Many thanks to my collaborators: Prof.Ajay Jasra and Dr.Neil Chada

Description:

1. MLEnKBF contains the main function, including the (deterministic) ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter (EnKBF), (deterministic) coupled ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter (CEnKBF), as well as the (deterministic) multilevel Ensemble Kalman-Bucy filter. A model-generation function is also included for 10 dimensional implemtations.
2. The simulation including parameter tuning and final runs are done on KAUST super computer Shaheen.
